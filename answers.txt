1. .gitignore files tells Git which files to ignore when commiting a project to Github repository. It should include *.class,*.jar,*.war,*.ear,*.nar for a java project.

2. Fast-forward merges literally move your main branch's tip forward to the end of your feature branch. In this case, a user can simulate a fast-forward by rebasing rather than merging.

3. Branching allows to branch out from the original code base and isolate the work from others. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.

4. In a project, we can have as many remote repositories as we want but we can have only one remote with name 'origin'.
